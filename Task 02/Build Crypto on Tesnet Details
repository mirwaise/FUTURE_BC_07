Excited to share a milestone from my journey with the Future Intern program!

Just launched my first testnet token, Mirwaise (MK), an ERC-20 token with a 100M supply, on the network today. Witnessing my code in action on the blockchain is truly rewarding.

This experience has been a valuable hands-on lesson in smart contract fundamentals. hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#Web3 hashtag#SmartContract hashtag#ERC20 hashtag#Developer hashtag#Blockchain hashtag#Bengaluru
