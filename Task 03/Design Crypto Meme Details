Thrilled to have just completed my latest task for the Future Intern program!

Meme : "Be Your Own Bank"

Why wait for banking hours in a 24/7 world?
This visual captures the shift from permission-based finance to true self-sovereignty. Decentralized technology like Bitcoin empowers you with direct control over your assets, anytime and anywhere.
Is this the future of personal finance?

 Meme : "Inflation Hedge"

What makes an asset a good store of value? This image highlights a key factor: supply.
While traditional currency supply can expand infinitely, Bitcoin has a fixed, verifiable supply of 21 million. This predictable scarcity is why many are exploring it as a powerful hedge against inflation.
A crucial concept for long-term financial strategy.
